1.	Parent and child process 
Write a C/CPP program to create a child process. Child should print its pid and its parent’s pid and should exit by printing message as “Child Exiting …”. Parent should print its pid and should exit by printing message as “Parent Exiting ..”. 
(Hint(functions to be used) : getpid, fork, getppid) 


#include<iostream>
#include <unistd.h>

using namespace std;

int main()

{
 pid_t pid;

pid = fork();

if (pid < 0)
{
   printf("fork is failed\n");
   return -1;
}

if (pid == 0)
{
   sleep(2);
   printf("It is a child process: %d\n", getpid());
   printf("child'S parent process: %d\n", getppid());
   sleep(20);
}

else
{
         sleep(3);
         printf("It is a parent process \n");
         printf("parents own id:%d \n",getpid());
         printf("parent's child id:%d \n",pid);
         printf("parent's parent (terminal) id: %d\n",getppid());
         sleep(30);
}
